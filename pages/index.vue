          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>Our mission is to help the dogs and cats who cannot help themselves.  Animals in need come to us from shelters, impounds, and owner surrenders and receive the veterinary care and behavioral support they need to place them in permanent, loving homes.  We collaborate with other rescues, veterinary clinics, and trainers to ensure the best placement for each animal, while also providing support and resources for families after adoption.</p>

              <h3>Rescue</h3>
              <p>We connect with local partners to find positive solutions for the animals in need. Once they are secured in a foster home you can look into their eyes and see things are going to get better for them.</p>

              <h3>Rehabilitate</h3>
              <p>If a dog or cat needs medical attention, extra time to understand theyâ€™re in a safe place, or simply better social skills, our team at NLR is up for the challenge. Each animal is individually assessed and cared for by our experienced team.</p>

              <h3>Homing</h3>
              <p>Any foster parent will tell you how wonderful it is to find the right home for the pet they've been caring for. They will also tell you it's tough to let them go! That's simply because our hearts are in the right place.</p>

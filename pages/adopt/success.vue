              <p>Sweet little Max came from a southern rescue where they have more pups than then can find families. After bringing him up to New Leash Rescue, he found his new family and is living happily fur-ever after!</p>

              <h3>Rosie</h3>
              <p>Rosie went from being a stray on a reservation, covered in ticks, and not quite sure of what was going to happen next to safe in a loving foster home. After looking for a while, she finally found her forever family! She's going to have a blast living with her two human siblings and her new mom and dad. The family was ready for a new "fur-baby" to join their home after grieving the loss of their beloved pup. Good luck Rosie! We are super happy we were able to be a part of your journey.</p>

              <h3>Ghost</h3>
              <p>Ghost was a rescue from the Island of St. Croix. When he arrived, we discovered he had cancer in his tail. Many rescues would not have helped Ghost, but through our awesome supporters and volunteers, we were able to save him by amputating his tail and we found him a great new family!</p>

              <h3>Willow</h3>
              <p>Willow was born with a defect that caused one of her front paws to not develop correctly. She could not use her leg and was getting sores from dragging it. We were able to get her the care she needed through our great vet partners and donations from our caring followers. Now she has a new mom and husky big sister and is the happiest pup around!</p>

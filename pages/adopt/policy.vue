          <p>All animals in the household must be spayed or neutered and up to date on vaccinations. Dogs and cats must be indoor pets only and any active dogs will require a fenced in yard or active family who will ensure the dog gets the exercise they need.</p>
          <p>Dogs are adopted to households with kids that are at least 5 years old to ensure the kids are old enough to understand the play of dogs. Most dogs will scratch during play with teeth and nails. With dogs under 15 lbs, children in the household must be at least 10. Some exceptions are made by the approval of the coordinator. We do not adopt puppies to a household that has never had a dog before. We do not place dogs in daycare facilities. Cats will be matched with a family that best fits the needs of the specific cat.</p>
          <p>We do adopt to those in rental homes if they have lived in the rental home for least 2 years and have had dogs and/or cats as an adult before. A contract or lease must be shown. We almost never adopt dogs over 40 lbs or any puppies to rental units; an exception would be for a senior large breed dog.</p>

          <p>Your gift could be matched dollar-for-dollar by your employer. Contact your company's human resources department and ask for employee gifts to be matched to New Leash Rescue. As a 501(c)(3) we qualify for most corporate gift matching programs.  Double your money for New Leash Rescue just by asking your company to participate.</p>
